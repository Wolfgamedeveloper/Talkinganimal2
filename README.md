Esse jogo foi o melhor projeto já feito por mim até hoje pois tem características únicas e foi avaliado por beta testers que o descreveram como um projeto com as melhores músicas E melhor interface tem várias cenas e ainda tem um tamanho entre 70 e 80 MB o desenvolvimento durou 3 meses e a aprovação dos betatesters durou 1 mês
e é o jogo de que mais me orgulho pois é uma homenagem aos meus animais de vitória por isso senti-me na obrigação de o tornar melhor do que o meu segundo jogo (animal falante) já era bom mas acrescentei tu tudo o que pude mesmo sendo algo inútil e descoberto-se que nada era inútil tudo era valorizadotudo que eu podia até ser algo inútil e acabou que nada era inútil tudo era valorizado pela comunidade e por isso ele tinha um sistema bem diferente do bicho falante. entre essas diferenças: uma aba para trocar a skin original do Biel skins disponíveis: deus guardião, algodão mMasterChef, sly karate, Guardian, cotton, sly, akim, Pedro, Arthur, Robson, Simone, ale. Havia um pátio, um menu para jogar minijogos: corrida de ufo, corrida de barco, karaokê, área de ataque, tiro ao alvo now it has a loading menu and another one which is the main one and now the tab to teleport to other worlds is in the main menu and to teleport you need a code that takes you to the world.O the game has automatic sprites that change when you do any action, there is Biel's initial sprite, he has him eating, sleeping and taking a shower and if you change skin and do any action that which changes the sprite you back to the initial sprite. It was a game that I was so proud of and I am still proud of today and it is the best I have made so far I had a lot of pleasure in developing it and during this month this development I learned new commands that I can use in any game I create and these new commands join forces for the games to improve even more.

<h1 align="center"> what was going to be added but wasn't: </h1>
there would be more functions in the calopsiter but they weren't put by the platform it couldn't handle very heavy projects more potions and more functions were going to be added in the laboratory but they weren't for the same target shooting cockatiel motif would be better and easier to play but there was no way to make such complex commands and it would also have scoring and a system that pays coins when you play the games and it didn't because in pocket code it's impossible to share the same variable between 2 different scenes and make it have the same functionality 

<h1 align="center">  betatesters comments: </H1>
everyone was blown away by the game and only made comments praising the game saying that it didn't need to improve because it was already well done with great graphics great music and a impeccable interface and what really impressed them was the ufo race with the background the difficulty the interface the gameplay and especially the music that plays whenever they want to play ufo race several times in the end they approved
